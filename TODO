Rework for lgpio library

SPI bus
 - Teensy : Design instruction encoding (already started a bit in Teensy.ino),
    could be inspired from DE0 encoding for servomotors/steppers
    Ideas :  - 8-bit header for query + redundancy check (e.g. parity bit) 
             - Modes for position control, remote speed control, slow position control, backward movement, turn around, ...
 - DE0 : Design query system for the different functionalities (to be merged with DE0 implem, see other repo)
 - Tests
 - Increase clock frequency (as much as possible)
    Limiting factor will probably be the DE0 clock of 50MHz, compared to Teensy's 600MHz

Dynamixels : find a good library on github for easy use
Lidar : balise ok, plant detection is the next step ? Not sure, ask Pauline
Path planning (soon)
Strategy (soon)
Homologation constraints implem + verif
Fun stuff (eg, live control with keyboard, OLED screen)
